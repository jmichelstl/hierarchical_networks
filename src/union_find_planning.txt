Plan for Union Find:

-Data:
	-Array to hold root indices
	-Array to hold sizes of trees

public functions

-Constructor
	-Takes no arguments, initializes empty arrays for indices and tree sizes

-union
	-Joins two indices
	-Makes sure both are non-negative
	-If either index is greater than the largest index currently stored, expand the
	tables of roots and tree sizes up to that index
	-Call find() on both indices
	-Look up size of tree for the root of each index
	-Make the root with the larger tree the parent of the root with the smaller tree
	-Add the size of the tree for the subordiate root to the size of the tree of the
	dominate root

-find
	-Make sure indices are in bounds
	-Call root on both indices
	-Return true if the roots are equal
	-Return false otherwise

private functions

-root
	-Make sure the index is in bounds
	while(id[i] != i){
		id[i] = id[id[i]];
		i = id[i];
	}
	return i;
