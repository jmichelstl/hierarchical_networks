-Make ordered groups of points to define polygons

-Process each polygon to find a point in its interior, as well as normal vectors

-Call Triangle to produce a triangulation for the top and bottom

-Finding holes and normals:
	For the first edge in a polygon:
		-Find change in x and y from the first to the second point
		-Find the midpoint of the line segment, m
		-Calculate two points: m + (-dy, dx) and m - (-dy, dx)
		-Determine which, if either, of these points is in the polygon
		-If neither is inside, halve dx and dy, and try again
		-When a match is found, note wheter m + (-dy, dx) or m - (-dy, dx)
		is the proper convention
		-Record the interior point as a hole
