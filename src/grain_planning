-Pair a list of edges with a list of polygons
-For each polygon, find the edges parallel to the original edge
-Find the angle made by these edges with the x axis, and rotate these edges by the opposite
of this angle
-After rotating, find the y separation, and the maximum left coordinate and minimum right
coordinate
-Use these coordinates as the bounds for a small-scale lattice
-In addition to the newly created lattice, add edges according to the following rules:
	-If the minimum x coordinate of the lower edge is less than the left x coordinate
	used to generate the lattice, add an edge extending from the minimum x coordinate
	to the left x coordinate
	-If the maximum x coordinate of the lower edge is greater than the right x
	coordinate used to make the lattice, add an edge from the right x coordinate
	to the maximum x coordinate
	-Repeat these considerations for the upper edge
	-Add these edges, as well as left and right edges of the lattice, to a set of
	edges to be used in triangulating junctions of large-scale edges
-Apply the reverse of the initial rotation to all edges created
-Add the lattice edges to the general pool of small-scale edges, and add the bounding
edges for triangulation to a separate pool
