Multithreading the force loop:

-Iterate over the neighbor map and count the total number of entries
-Obtain the desired number of threads
-Divide the total number of entries by n to obtain the target number for each thread
-If adding a list to a thread would not exceed the target number of neighbors, add the
whole list
-If adding the lsit would exceed the number of neighbors, just add part of the list
-Keep track of the index of the first list, and the index at which to begin
-Also keep track of the last list index, and the last index within that list the thread should process
-Once one thread is at capacity, move to the next one

When a worker thread is invoked:
-Pass the index to the first neighbor list, and the first index within that list
-Pass the index to the last neighbor list, and the last index within that list
